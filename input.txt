Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we live and work. From smart assistants like Siri and Alexa to more complex systems such as self-driving cars and medical diagnosis tools, AI is becoming increasingly integrated into our daily lives. 

Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning, in particular, is responsible for major breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and other fields.

As AI technology continues to advance, ethical concerns around privacy, job displacement, and algorithmic bias must be addressed to ensure it benefits all of humanity.
